Analysis of these cells showed that they preserved their stemness and were able to proliferate in space while also remaining as NSCs after 39.3 days unattended in the same culture medium in space. These in-space NSCs were able to maintain their ability to become young neurons when cultured in neuronal specification media (NSM) upon return, indicating that exposure to microgravity in space did n",

To conduct an assay in which NK cells were continuously exposed to conditions of microgravity, four HARVs were used simultaneously. NK-92MI cells were cultured in simulated microgravity in two HARVs for 48 h. Without stopping rotation (and therefore maintaining the cells in freefall), the HARVs were sampled to assess cell density and viability. Leukemic ce",

    "riesgos": "One interpretation of our findings is that during short-term HU, young males mitigate oxidative damage more effectively than young females. Alternatively, it is possible that the kinetics of the emergence and repair of oxidative damage are sexually dimorphic. It is also unclear whether sex differences in oxidative stress responses persist due to unavailability of samples at later timepoints. Further, short-term HU in older males does not appear to enhance oxidative damage. Although not statistic",
